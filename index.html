<p>Tern is a stand-alone <strong>code-analysis engine</strong> for
JavaScript. It is intended to be used with a <a href="#plugins">code
editor plugin</a> to enhance the editor's support for intelligent
JavaScript editing. Features provided are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Autocompletion on variables and properties
  <li>Function argument hints
  <li>Querying the type of an expression
  <li>Finding the definition of something
  <li>Automatic refactoring
</ul>

<p>Tern is open-source (<a href="LICENSE">MIT license</a>), written in
JavaScript, and capable of running both
on <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> and in
the <a href="doc/demo.html">browser</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plugins">Editor plugins</h2>

<p>There is currently Tern support for the following editors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emacs
  <li>Vim
  <li>Sublime Text
</ul>

<p>None of these are currently properly packaged, easy to install, or
well documented. Expect that to change in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2 id="support">Community and support</h2>

<p>There are two mailing lists for the project, a low-volume one for
announcements
at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/tern-announce">tern-announce</a>,
and an open one where everyone can post
at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/tern-dev">tern-dev</a>.
For reporting bugs, I prefer that you use
the <a href="https://github.com/marijnh/tern/issues?state=open">github
issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Code contributions are welcome, preferably
through <a href="https://github.com/marijnh/tern/pulls">pull
requests</a>.</p>

<p>The maintainer of the project
(<a href="mailto:marijnh@gmail.com">Marijn Haverbeke</a>) is, in
principle, available for consulting work around Tern. Commercial
support contracts are also possible. Contact me for details.</p>

<h2 id="docs">Documentation</h2>

<p>The <a href="doc/manual.html">reference manual</a> should be your
first stop for figuring out how to use Tern.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the way the system works internally, take
a look at this <a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/tern.html">blog
post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="releases">Release history</h2>

<p>No official release of Tern has been brought out yet. This will
change soon.</p>
