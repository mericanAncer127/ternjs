# Tern

This is [Tern][1]. Tern is a stand-alone, editor-independant
JavaScript analyzer that can be used to improve the JavaScript
integration of existing editors. It currently comes only with an
[online demo][1], but I am hard at work on Emacs and Vim plug-ins.

Thanks to a group of generous [crowd funders][2], Tern is open-source
software, under an MIT license.
