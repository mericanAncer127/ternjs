# Tern

This is [Tern][1]. Tern is *not* open-source yet ([details][2]). Feel
free to browse the source, which by the way is still rough and messy
and undocumented, but be aware that I'm retaining all copyrights
unless the crowd-funding campaign succeeds.

The [website][1] explains properly what Tern is, and even comes with a
demo. But, in short, Tern is a type inference engine and code querying
system that is designed to be used by (thin) editor plug-ins to
provide a sane editing experience when working with JavaScript. It
takes files JavaScript code, in all their dynamic wonkiness, and tries
very hard to make as much sense as possible out of them.
